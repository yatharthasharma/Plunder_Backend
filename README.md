This repository contains the back-end logic for the Plunder app. The repository containing the app code, can be found here: [Plunder](https://github.com/SzyJ/Plunder)

## How it works
The logic in the PHP files is used to communicate with a MySQL database that contains all app data. User profiles, created hunts, created Plunders...

The location and credentials used for the database can be configured in the ```init.php``` file.
